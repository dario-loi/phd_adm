Good  Afternoon <PROF>
 
I am a student at the University of Rome La Sapienza, currently undertaking my last year of Master's degree in Computer Science. I am now interested in starting a doctoral course in computer science, centering the doctoral degree on <PROFESSOR's RESEARCH AREA>.
 
Throughout my academic career I have developed a keen interest in complex systems and more importantly towards their modelling. I have managed to start gaining expertise in the field of complex systems participating in additional courses  targeted towards students with outstanding grades. Throughout this period I have investigated economic systems with the new measure of the Economic Fitness. I had the opportunity to undergo this work experience thanks to the supervision of Professor Luciano Pietronero. I am now interested in considering neural networks both as complex systems and as tools capable of analyzing them. At the moment I am working on my thesis, still supervised by Professor Pietronero. In my thesis I am working on  neural networks' learning theory.
I hope I will not bother you with this email by asking if you will be planning to accept a doctoral student with a focus on these topics within the next academic year.

[Optional] Finally, as this email might come a bit too early, if you have any advice on the skills or qualities that you would require from a possible candidate, I would be happy to work on gaining them by the time a project would be available.
 
Thank you so much for your patience and for your time.
 
I hope to hear back from you soon.
 
Kind regards,
Francesco Caso
